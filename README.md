Youtoube - i followed a guide by web cifar, a youtube series. Although i did add some of my own code just to fulfill the requirements of the project. Below I will link all youtube videos I watched for this portfolio. Also I'd like to make it clear that although i followed the guide, I ommitted what was not necessary and wrote my own code for what was required.

Although I regretted following a tutorial halfway through, I'm glad that I followed through with it because I learned alot about styled components, react and javascript and css. If anyone asks me whats the best way to learn react I'm definitely going to reccomend them this guide.

## Struggles

My biggest struggle was mobile responsiveness, although media queries seem easy to write in theory to me, I always end up with the component im trying to style looking ugly. Also a small thing but still very annoying was finding a way to link outside of a website in react, StackOverflow couldn't help me and neither could ASKBCS. I ended up eventually just making anchor tags instead of using my button component.
